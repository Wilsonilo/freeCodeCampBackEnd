# VotingX

Repo for the project "Building a Voting App" from freecodecamp.org.

[https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-voting-app](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-voting-app)

### Notes:
* Project uses Angular 2 + and other dependencies, check package.json
* I mainly use 4 enviroments vars to work with the app
	*  **proccess.env.MLABDB** which connects to the Mlab database.
	*  **APIKEYSEARCHGOOGLE** as a secret/salt for different parts of the app (can be whatever you want does not need to be an actual API Key from Google i just felt lazy)
	*  **FREECODECAMPTWITTERKEY** and **FREECODECAMPTWITTERSECRET** for the Twitter Auth API.

	
### Road:

I hope once i finish some projects get a little bit more security, design and details on the app.

### Versions:

* 1.0.0 (22/08/2017)
